#Hackme

Welcome to hackme, an information security exercise for COS342 (Fall 2015) at Taylor University.

For this project, I was given some dangerously bad code and instructed to fix it as well as do a writeup on what types of attacks would be possible with this code.

You can see how the system initially looked in the very first commit. A comparison between the first commit and the last can be [found here](https://github.com/BoringCode/hackme/compare/c736875ab5e141e33ed3966d6690515e7770a079...8080565b3613c265f41345ba95313d130b8b98b3).

Please be warned that this **is not production code** and should only be used as an exercise in securing a web application. I may have missed stuff, and there are certainly some code style things I would like to fix (if I had time.)

##Writeup

You can read the writeup in [project-essay.md](project-essay.md) and [project-essay-part-2.md](project-essay-part-2.md).
